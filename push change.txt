If you have added new code to your project and want to upload it to GitHub, follow these steps:  

### **Step 1: Open Your Project Folder in Terminal**  
Navigate to your project folder using the terminal (Git Bash on Windows or Terminal on Mac/Linux):  
```sh
cd /path/to/your/project
```

### **Step 2: Check for Changes**  
See which files have been changed, added, or deleted:  
```sh
git status
```

### **Step 3: Add the New Code to Git**  
To add all changes to Git, run:  
```sh
git add .
```
If you want to add a specific file, use:  
```sh
git add filename.ext
```

### **Step 4: Commit the Changes**  
Commit the changes with a message describing what you added or modified:  
```sh
git commit -m "Added new feature or updated code"
```

### **Step 5: Push the Changes to GitHub**  
Upload the changes to GitHub by running:  
```sh
git push origin main
```
(Replace `main` with your branch name if you're using a different one.)

### **Step 6: Verify on GitHub**  
Go to your GitHub repository URL and check if the new code is uploaded.  

That's it! ðŸŽ‰ You have successfully updated your project on GitHub. ðŸš€
